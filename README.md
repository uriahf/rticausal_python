# rticausal_python

Python implementation of rticausal for external validation and evaluation of predictions under interventions.

Import package:

```python
import rticausal
```

Initial public API:

```python
rticausal.create_calibration_curve()
rticausal.create_summary_report()
```

For factual calibration, `rticausal` delegates directly to `rtichoke`.

For intervention-specific calibration, `probs` contains one or more model/prediction series for the same intervention, `treats` contains observed treatment assignments, `intervention` identifies the treatment level being evaluated, and `weights` optionally supplies identification/design weights. The package does not fit propensity models.

The intervention calibration coordinates follow `ipeval` calibration semantics: predictions are sorted and divided into 8 rank groups by default (or fewer when there are fewer unique prediction values); the plotted predicted value is the unweighted mean prediction among all subjects in each group, and the observed value is the weighted mean outcome among subjects observed under the intervention of interest. A different group count can be supplied with `groups`.

The initial scope is static binary discrete calibration. `create_summary_report()` contains calibration only. Existing `rtichoke_python` rendering machinery is reused after the calibration coordinates are prepared.
